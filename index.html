    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a 27 years old young person. I speak Turkish (my mother language), English and German. I can describe myself as a hard-working, orginized, solution-oriented and willing to learn teammate. I am personally interested in the IT field. I have a bachelor's degree in b+Business Administration. And I'm trying to develop myself in the field of IT, in the field of program development. Although this is only theoretical training, I would like to state that I have had Java programming classes during my bachelor's degree.

        After that I worked in Istanbul, in a textile company as an assistant manager. My tasks there were analyzing and organizing. And MS Office programs, Minitab and Excel Macro were the systems I used.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have been living in Germany since October 2020 and have a residence and work permit here. I quickly completed my integration course. After that I improved my German skills. Ultimately, I have a C1 German certificate. I am currently attending a computer science course. At the same time, I'm trying to improve myself in the field of IT (especially Python, HTML/CSS/JS, GitHub) with online courses.
